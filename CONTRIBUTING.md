# Contributing

Contributions, issues and feature requests are very welcome. If you are using this package and fixed a bug for yourself, please consider submitting a PR! Also you can ping me at [Twitter](https://twitter.com/seol_hooney)

## Guidelines

If you will develop some pull request, it's very important follow these basic rules:

### Commit messages

Commit messages should follow the [commit message convention](https://conventionalcommits.org/) so that changelogs can be automatically generated. Commit messages will be automatically validated upon commit. If you are not familiar with the commit message convention, you can use `yarn commit` instead of `git commit`, which provides an interactive CLI for generating proper commit messages.

### General guidelines

- The master branch is basically just a snapshot of the latest stable release. All development should be done in dedicated branch. **Do not submit PRs against the master branch.**
- Checkout a topic branch from the relevant branch, e.g. `develop`, and merge back against that branch.
- Work in the **src** folder of respective package and **DO NOT** checkin dist in the commits.
- It's OK - and a very nice thing - to have multiple small commits as you work on the PR - we will let GitHub automatically squash it before merging.

### If adding new feature:

- Make sure that [all examples](https://github.com/Seolhun/localize-components/tree/master/packages/examples) are running as expected
- Provide convincing reason to add this feature. Ideally you should open a suggestion issue first and have it greenlighted before working on it.
